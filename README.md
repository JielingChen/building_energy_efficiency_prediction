# Building Energy Efficiency Prediction
This project is my homework for CIS 9660 - Data Mining for Business Analytics.  
The goal of this project is to utilize the energy efficiency dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/242/energy+efficiency) and develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the heating and cooling loads of residential buildings.

The project is divided into six distinct parts, each serving a specific purpose:  

**(1) Introduction:**  
* Provides an overview of the project and its objectives.  


**(2) Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:**  
* Involves a thorough examination of the dataset to gain insights and identify patterns.
* Performs feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the models.  


**(3) Linear Regression Model:**  
* Implements a linear regression model as a benchmark for performance comparison.
* Assesses the accuracy and effectiveness of the linear regression model.  

    
**(4) Model Selection:**  
* Utilizes leave-one-out cross-validation technique to evaluate and select the most suitable model.
* Explores various machine learning algorithms and compares their performance.  

    
**(5) Model Validation:**  
*  Validates the chosen model using an independent dataset to assess its generalization capability.
* Evaluates the performance of the selected model based on specific metrics.  


**(6) Business Insights:**  
* Extracts meaningful insights from the predictive models and their outcomes.  


Parts (1)-(3) were completed in accordance with the instructor's requirements, while parts (4)-(6) were undertaken based on personal interest, aiming to augment the analysis and enrich the overall findings.
